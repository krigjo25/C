# Runoff

## About Runoff

Implements a CS program to simulate a runnoff voting

Linear search Algorithm was used in the project to find the candidate which had the lowest vote.
So the candidate could be eliminated from the election.

Even if Linear Search Algorithm has a BC at log O(n) and the element could be hidden in the last index,
Its well suited for small datasets, and it doesnt require more memory to be implemented,
it would mean the algorithm doesn't need to be sorted in any way.

Originally this project was created as an assignment at xCS50
