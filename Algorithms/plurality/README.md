# Pularity

## About Pularity

Implements a CS program to simulate a voting as Pularity

Linear search Algorithm was used to find the candidate which had the highest vote.
Even if Linear Search Algorithm has a BC at log O(n) and the element could be hidden in the last index,
Its well suited for small datasets, and doesnt require additional memory as the content doesn't need to be sorted.


Originally this project was created as an assignment at xCS50
